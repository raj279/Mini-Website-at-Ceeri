These are the changes you need to make in your C:\xampp\htdocs\ceeri folder.


Firsty make sure you have a copy of all the files of your ceeri folder somewhere else.

Now delete the index.php file and final.php files from ceeri folder

Download these files and keep them in your ceeri folder: index.php, dateselect.php, data.php, loginform.inc.php, logoutform.inc.php, core.inc.php, backgr.css, loginform.css, file_upload.php

final.php is now renamed to data.php
index.php is now renamed to dateselect.php
and the new index.php is the first login page.

Now open your browser and go to this link: localhost/phpmyadmin
From the left panel open 'users' database
create a new table by clicking 'new'
Create a new table with name 'users'
id: int primary index AI
username: varchar length:30
password: varchar length:64

The click on GO
open table

enter these details; 
id=1 
username=ceeri_pilani 
password= 6e8a12f836a828fd3a02847da037d3c6

click on GO/save

Now the data is saved with a login form.
